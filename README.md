# ft_printf
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.

```
- For program: make
- Navigate ft_printf_main_test.c to same level with program
- Arrange your libraries according to your level
- Compile libftprintf.a and ft_printf_main_test.c (There will be warning you do not have to care)
- Main starts from line 658, you can command out whichever function would you like to test.

PS: for bonus tests it is quite garbage, hard to understand and clarfy. I whenever I find a gap in my schedule I will fix.
